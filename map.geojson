was a must. It was a lovely short trip and the first time experiencing the Pacific Ocean and its prodigious waves. We enjoyed seeing the kiteboarders and the windsurfers while we took a walk down the beach. The beach was clean and fairly populated, and we had no problem finding parking.","api-feels-like":"61.5‚Ñâ","api-humidity":"88%","api-wind-speed":"3.4
